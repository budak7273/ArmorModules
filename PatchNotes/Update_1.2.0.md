Has increased fuel and power consumption to balance with its better mobility.

- New **Vertical Thruster Module** that significantly boosts vertical ascent speed.
- New icon for the **Horizontal Thruster Module**.
- Better descriptions on the Air Dampening Modules. Also **Strong Air Dampening** has a fuel efficiency stat now.
