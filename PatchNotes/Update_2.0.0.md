# Patch Notes
**Big update here!** Thank you to those that have been sending feedback my way - I've tried to incorporate as much of it as I can into this update.

There are now 45+ modules to play with, and 1 new suit!

Compatibility with PowerSuit version 0.4.0 and game version 138299

There are probably a few changes I forgot to list here, but I tried to get them all. A ton of stuff has changed on the base PowerSuit mod as well to allow these features - thanks Nog!

## **Major changes - Please read!**
- **Movement speed variance fixes**
   - There have been issues in the past with movement speed and flight power varying drastically depending on the FPS of the user. These should be mostly fixed as of this update to this mod and the PowerSuit base mod. Horizontal movement speed is entirely fixed. One issue remains with ascent speed. Due to some trouble with base game systems, the lower your FPS, the higher your ascent speed. This is better than the (current) alternative of low FPS users not being able to fly at all.
- **Jetpack Overhaul**
    - It's finally here - jetpack variants that work more like the Vanilla jetpack.
    - **Jetpacks no longer refill in midair by default.** You must install a **Mid-Air Refueling Module** to have this behavior again.
    - **You no longer have to double tap space to enter flying mode** - just hold space and the suit will start to fly. Hover mode is now toggled with `Ctrl`+`Space`, which also lets you stop flying while hovering.
    - **Jetpack sounds** implemented by Nog in the base PowerSuit mod. Huzzah!
    - The orange bar in the HUD means something different now. Read more in the Suit HUD section of the mod page.
- Power generation modules have drastically reduced Power Capacity bonuses. Capacity increases have been moved to other (new) modules.
- **Early Game Biofuel Suit**!
    - Craft a (limited) PowerSuit as soon as you get your hands on some Blade Runners.
    - Also unlocks a few modules to get you started.
- **Milestone Costs**
    - All milestones need to be purchased again after this update. Existing modules should be safe, though.
    - Milestones now have costs instead of being free, but purposely low ship return timers. Please contact me with milestone price feedback (or any other feedback you have regarding the mod)
    - When unlocking the milestones, you'll also get to hear the new...
- **ADA Messages!**
    - In preparation for eventual MAM compatibility, I made ADA messages for the milestones and have split up the milestones a bit more. 
    - Once the MAM integration works better with multiplayer I will be switching the milestones over to MAM research trees.
    - Message sending code based heavily off of what Panakotta uses in FICSIT Networks.
    - I'm not sure if these are multiplayer compatible - please let me know if they don't seem to be working in multiplayer for you.
- A **suit controls tutorial** can now be found in your Inbox's tutorial section after researching the Biofuel Suit.

## New Modules
- **Thrust Boots**
    - Early game jetpack. Very slow vertical ascent and range - mostly just for maintaining height or slowing falls.
- **Fuel Runners**
    - Fuel-powered sprinting! Also check out the modified S.L.I.D.E Module for fuel-powered sliding.
    - Consumes less power than Exoskeletons/Sprinting Compensators, but uses fuel.
- **Mid-Air Refueling Module**
    - Allows your Fuel reserves to refill while flying at an additional 10% fuel and energy cost.
- **Fuel Pumps Module**
    - Increases Fuel refill speed at the cost of fuel efficiency.
- **Hypertube Charging Coils Module**
    - Balance WIP.
    - Charges your suit at an impressive rate from your base's power network while using HyperTubes and not boosting.
    - Slightly lowers your max boosting speed and increases boosting power consumption.
- 3 tiers of Power Capacity Module
    - Balance WIP. I'm trying to make these worthwhile choices in place of more generators.
    - **Capacity Capacitors Module**
    - **'Fuel Cell' Module**
    - **Advanced Battery Bank Module**
- **Backup Capacitors Module**
    - Extra overdraw time before the suit shorts, increased reboot time.
- **Shield Generator Mk2**
    - Higher capacity and regen at a higher material and power cost.
- A few more top secret hidden modules! These are not included in the total of 45 modules, so there's actually more than 45.

## Recipe Tweaks
- Various alternate recipes are available for crafting Module Base Components.
- Alternate (renewable) recipe for shield emitter since there are a fair few things that use it.
- Bio Generator no longer requires Oil Processing tier items to make.
- Module Base Components now require Smart Plating to craft instead of Circuit Boards since they are accessible earlier in the game now.
- New Precision Thruster crafting component involved in some recipes now.
- Ballistics Fabric renamed to Protective Weave and introduced in some additional recipes.
- Drastically reduced cost of Ballistics Plating module. I accidentally set the recipe too high and never noticed until now.
- Hazmat module now requires aluminum plates instead of motors.
- Removed Turbomotor crafting requirement from Exoskeleton (combined walk and sprint) module.
- More I probably forgot.

## Module tweaks
- A number of modules that didn't have icons do now
- All pre-existing Jetpack modules no longer refuel while flying, requiring another module to grant this ability.
- **Vanilla-Style Jetpack Module**
    - Renamed to **Integrated Jetpack Module**
    - Now has vanilla jetpack 'press space to thrust' behavior - hold space to start flying up.
    - New feature - Press Left Alt to make a powered descent.
- **Fall Dampener Module** now only consumes power while Flight Falling and Flying Down. Its effects still kick in all the time.
- **Slug Amplification Generator**
    - Behavior changed significantly to make it more unique among the generators and give the user an interesting choice to make.
    - Now boosts power production by 10% at the cost of 10% capacity.
    - Bio generator is cheaper now.
- **HyperTube Accelerator Coils**
    - Now only consumes power when actually boosting.
    - New icon so it's visually distinct from the Hypertube Charging Coils.
- Health Regeneration modules nerf.
    - Free healing is quite strong and often removes the need for any shields. Lower regen rates to balance that out a bit, especially for the cheaper modules.
    - Mk1 0.5/s -> 0.25/s
    - Mk2 2/s -> 1/s and power cost upped to 25MW
    - Mk3 5/s -> 4/s
- **S.L.I.D.E. Module**
    - PowerSuits no longer provide infinite sliding time by default; you must install this module now for that functionality.
    - You can power slide by pressing Left Alt while sliding for a speed boost. The speed boost gets considerably faster as you add more modules.
    - Power sliding consumes Power.
    - This module gets pretty silly. I suggest you try out stacking a few of them.
- Hazmat and Gas Mask
    - Free filters forever is a bit too strong. It was suggested that these require suit fuel to run, but I don't want it blinking the HUD all the time, or for there to be too strong of a "penalty" for just having them on in your base.
    - No longer slow you down in flight.
    - Now consume 15 MW and 10 MW respectively at all times.
- Strong and Weak Air Dampening Modules
    - With the changes to how jetpacks work and how dampening is calculated, these modules don't really have much use any more. I have left them, in but made them inaccessible in new saves, since they don't really do anything to flight behavior now.
- Exoskeleton and Walking/Sprinting Compensator
    - Doubled speed bonuses so they are more competitive with the flight modules.
    - Use SLIDE modules to get moving really quickly on the ground.
- Added MP warning to **Night Vision Module** description. It only works for the host in multiplayer. I do not yet have the BP knowledge to fix this.

## Bugfixes
- The top secret hidden milestone is now T0 instead of T9, so having the mod installed shouldn't show extra tiers that don't actually exist in the HUB. Thanks Mase#4410 and Bando#6593 for finding this.
- Issue with flight thrust not kicking in when you start flying while falling fixed by Nog.
- A lot changed internally with PowerSuit between this version and the last, so lots of lingering problems were probably fixed and new ones introduced.

## Coming Soonâ„¢
- A few people have been requesting that the suits accept Batteries as a fuel source, or to have some other higher energy fuel source than just packaged fuel and turbofuel. I have created this item, but I'm having issues overriding the suits added in the base PowerSuit mod to accept them. As such, this item will be coming out in a future update.
- Almost all of the mod's elements pull their text from String Tables now, which means localized copies of the mods are within reach. Please contact me if you would like to help translate the mod to another language.
