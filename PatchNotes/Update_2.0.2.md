# Be sure to check out the patch notes for [Version 2.0.0](https://ficsit.app/mod/BezrE8aswqXLRX/version/7hefVFwfYeBzR5/view) if you haven't yet!
A couple small changes on top of 2.0.0

## Bugfixes
- The Thrust Boots module now correctly consumes fuel and power when "boosting." It doesn't have a boost mode, so the consumption is the same as regular ascent. It accidentally consumed none. Thanks OrionSincoatToday for finding this.
