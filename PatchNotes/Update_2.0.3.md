# Be sure to check out the patch notes for [Version 2.0.0](https://ficsit.app/mod/BezrE8aswqXLRX/version/7hefVFwfYeBzR5/view) if you haven't yet!

## Tweaks
- The fuel consumption of the Integrated Jetpack Module and Hover Jetpack Module has been reduced.
- All crafting components now have a small note in the description reminding you where you can craft them.


## Bugfixes
All bugfixes in this update were changes made on the base PowerSuit mod side. If it broke something, blame me, not Nog.
- Jetpack sounds now follow the Effects (and Master) volume sliders in the ingame settings. Fixes [this issue](https://github.com/Nogg-aholic/PowerSuit/issues/5).
- Jetpack sounds should fall off correctly with distance now - hopefully no more hearing everyone at a constant volume across the map.
- Consuming fuel items to refill the buffer no longer reboots the suit early, which would prevent movement speeds from being set correctly (affected Fuel Runners and Integrated Blade Runners). Fixes [this issue](https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/issues/5).
