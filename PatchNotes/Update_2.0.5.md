# Be sure to check out the patch notes for [Version 2.0.0](https://ficsit.app/mod/BezrE8aswqXLRX/version/7hefVFwfYeBzR5/view) if you haven't yet!


## Bugfixes
- The Biofuel Suit accidentally required an Integrated Blade Runners module to craft. It now requires just regular Blade Runners, and as such should be priced appropriately for its tier. (Thanks maskedmouse for the report)
    - Base Modules are supposed to be expensive at that point. If you need Heavy Modular frames, consider looking at crash sites for some.
- The Integrated Blade Runners module should now actually reduce fall damage instead of make you more vulnerable to it. Whoops. (Thanks Brandon {RDM} for the report)
    - The Mk1-3 suits have a hidden fall damage reduction property that will likely be removed in the next update. This bug was found because the Biofuel Suit does not have that hidden property.
