Fix handheld hoverpack controller visuals and mobile Fabrication Station crafting time issue




## New Stuff

- Sub-Mods list (in the Main menu, MAM, and Fabrication Station) now shows version of each sub-mod on hover
- The sub-mods list now correctly appears in the Mobile Fabrication Station, which was not previously implemented

## Bugfixes

- Handheld hoverpack controllers are once again back in your hands
  - Remember - if you don't like the controllers, you can hide them in the mod configs.
- Fixed an issue that was causing all items to craft 8x faster than intended at the Mobile Fabrication Station

## Known Bugs

- Some of the **item conveyor meshes are broken** due to changes to the Conveyor Rendering System. In particular, the ones with cool animations like the Somerslink Regulators. I will probably have to talk to Ben or Beaver to figure out how to fix them.
- In-place swapping of modules inside the suit can cause the stats of the modules to be double-counted until you re-equip the suit. This was a result of partially fixing a crash, but I don't have time to fully fix this right now.
