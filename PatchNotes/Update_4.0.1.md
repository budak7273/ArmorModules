Hotfix for incompatibility with Sorting the Unsortable and Magic Machine. UI sizing fixes.




Be sure to read the 4.0.0 changelog - lots of stuff changed!

## Bugfixes

- Fixed crash when hovering over items an the inventory when 'Sorting the Unsortable' or 'Magic Machine' are installed. Thanks Katarina for finding this!
- Changed layout structure of the suit HUD so 4k resolutions with UI scaling applied don't do weird things to the text alignment. UI is identical on non-4k. Thanks Poogasthe13th for tracking this down to 4k with UI scaling!
- Fixed spacing of the Somerslink crafting items' extra info tooltip
