Fix typo in some MAM node descriptions. Abstract instance support for the Remote Access module.




## Bugfixes

- Fixed that the Remote Access module would see Abstract Instances (walls, foundations, splitters, etc as of Update 7) as the Abstract Instance Manager instead of their true actors.
- Fixed that the Plutonium and Somerslinked fuel cells had outdated description texts in the MAM.
  - Thanks Speedy for bringing these to my attention
