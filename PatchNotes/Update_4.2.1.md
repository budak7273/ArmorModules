## Known Bugs

See the [Github Issues page](https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/issues) and the top of the mod page for more info. Also check out the known bugs for PowerSuit as well.

- Integrated Jetpack Module is not as nimble when air strafing as the base game's jetpack
- Rebinding keys may sometimes require you to re-equip your suit for the changes to take effect
- ADA voice messages added by the mod do not play
- It is sometimes still possible to escape hypertubes with flight even without the relevant module installed

<!-- 
Maybe later

- Move Suit Mk1 earlier in progression
- Consider moving balance settings to session settings
- MoveC mJumpOffLadderVelocity module?
- moveC mEnableVaultPrototype module?
- Upon max shield recalc, cap current shield to new max
- Draw atop actual health bar with shield blocks, Tinkers' Construct style
  - Might be confusing for stuff that goes through shield
- Boombox back module - make a boombox dropped in the world travel with you
  - Keybind to trigger the thump?
- Make separate Basic and Advanced suit components later? or is this just parts bloat

- TODO Added [TFIT - The Ficsit Information Tool](https://ficsit.app/mod/TFIT) to the All Modules Modpack.
  - PowerSuit Modules will soon take advantage of this mod's features to offer tooltips for modules and suits that are easier to read and more informative.
  - By default, the mod hides the "Recipes" section of tooltips unless you are holding your Sprint key, making it easier to read longer item tooltips that could otherwise be pushed offscreen.
  - Don't like one of the mod's features? Two options:
    - Disable it in the Mod Configs for TFIT - the mod is incredibly configurable!
    - Unsubscribe from the "All Modules Modpack" mod and instead subscribe to the individual mods you want to use. -->
