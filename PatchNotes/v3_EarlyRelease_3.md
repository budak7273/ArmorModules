# Hey, person from the future! These install directions are no longer valid, as these versions are out of date. Install using Satisfactory Mod Manager instead!


It's time for Early Release 3 of PowerSuit Modules (and the updated version of PowerSuit to go along with it, and all the other new goodies) at long last!

### Before continuing, please read the change logs I have attached for both PowerSuit and PowerSuit Modules, as they will help you get an idea of what changed and what to look for. If you find a bug, or something is confusing or misleading, please don't hesitate to let me know.

If you read them before for Early Release 1/2, please read them again, because **a LOT has changed**! Like, a whole lot.

PowerSuit Modules changelog: https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/blob/RestructureUnlocks/PatchNotes/Update_3.0.0.md

----

I suggest that you install a cheat mod of sorts (I personally use Item Spawner (no mp support) and [Nog's Cheats](https://ficsit.app/mod/DL3fU6mHkkGKbe) (has mp support)) to test out the mod. I do not suggest using the mod yet in your personal playthroughs yet since I am looking to change some milestone and module costs still, as well as possibly moving some items around (old ones could end up deleted). But if that's a risk you're fine with taking, by all means, go ahead.

## Here's what *isn't ready yet*:

- I do not yet have icons from Deantendo for the sub-mods, so right now they all use placeholder images or the main mod's icon.
	- **"What do you mean, sub-mods?"** - Go read the changelog!
- I am still figuring out some of the costs for various modules
- Any module that displays the "Incomplete" message in chat on equip is still WIP. They may not work as expected, if at all.
- Multiplayer is almost certain to still have some bugs, but anything that can crash you should already be fixed
- Note that if you install a cheat item spawning mod, you will have access to a bunch of modules that are for debugging purposes or aren't ready yet at all. Please stick to testing the modules that are normally accessible (can be found in HUB milestones)
- **Read the top of the changelog above to see current bugs**
- Probably more I forgot to list here

## Things to watch out for:

- **If you find a bug, please contact me about it and let me know the steps to reproduce it. Consider turning on the first level of debugging in the mod's config and sending me your logs.**
- If you find anything in the mod confusing, please don't hesitate to let me know. This mod is kind of complicated, and I want everything to be as easy to understand as possible. I am hoping the upcoming tooltip system and new icons will help with this.
- Test multiplayer if you would like, but see the notes above.
- During testing, I would very rarely get a crash when loading the main menu or a save file *after having already loaded one*. If you get this crash, please contact me with what you had in your suit at the time.

## Install Directions

0. Please read what I wrote above, and the patch notes I linked above, so you know what to look for when testing!
1. Locate your mods folder and **delete** any previous versions of:
- PowerSuit
- NogsPowerSuit
- PowerSuit Modules
- MAM Enhancer

...that you have installed. If you don't do this, SMR will try and replace the new version with the old version, which would not be good. If you don't do this, you will almost certainly crash on launch.

2. Download the zip I have linked below via the Nogs' Mods Discord (if you haven't joined yet, you can join [here](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu), and follow the directions here to install them:
- [Install Directions](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/ManualInstallDirections.html#_installing_your_mod_of_choice)
- [Zip with base mod, all sub-mods, required dependencies, and a bonus updated copy of NogsPowerSuit](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847973842525356113/864021236623605790/ArmorModules_EarlyRelease3.zip)

3. Launch the game, and you should see the 'EARLY RELEASE PowerSuit' and 'EARLY RELEASE PowerSuit Modules' mods listed on the mod menu, as well as a number of other mods, and a widget on the main menu as well.
4. You're good to go! Contact me if you have any issues.

Thanks for taking the time to read all this, and have fun!
