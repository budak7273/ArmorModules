### Major

- People have reportedly had issues entering and exiting vehicles. If you have any more info on this, please let us know. As of Update 4, this may no longer be a problem though.
- Modules do not always apply their usage costs correctly if you have the Toggle Sprint option on. We're working on this, but it has been a lower priority

### Minor

- Modules which display a warning message in the chat upon equip, or those tagged as WIP, may not be fully functioning yet.

This mod (with all [sub-mods](https://ficsit.app/mod/CEjJnBXkLEiszx) installed) adds a whole bunch (**57+**) of armor modules for use in your **multiplayer-compatible**
 [PowerSuit](https://ficsit.app/mod/7J2LyFzTakqPQ5), reminiscent of Factorio's [equipment module system](https://wiki.factorio.com/Power_armor_MK2). It introduces 4 different suits in which modules can be installed, the first of which is accessible as soon as you get Blade Runners.

Please report leave suggestions and report issues either in the [Nog's Mods Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu) or [as a Github issue](https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/issues/new/choose).

Although you can use this mod in tandem with the [NogsPowerSuit](https://ficsit.app/mod/FJJALSZBNhZ37d) mod, they are not balanced for each other in the slightest, and the Codename NGF module is basically a cheat module for developer testing. I would not recommend it.

## Feature Overview

- Customize the function of your PowerSuit to your liking.
There is no 'perfect' armor setup - you get to decide what is important to you.
- Work with R&D to develop 57+ modules to install across 7 new reseach trees! (_ADA voicelines not updated yet, sorry_)
- Combine the effects of the

Thrust Boots Module as soon as you get Blade Runners and Steel.
- Harness
![DirtyReactor](https://i.imgur.com/gOgUQvu.png)
nuclear power before T7 to power your suit, albeit with some risk to the user.
- Power-slide like a champ with with the rocket-assisted
![SLIDE](https://i.imgur.com/45XVK8q.png) S.L.I.D.E Module.
- Further augment your
![GreenLegs](https://i.imgur.com/vAlwH9e.png) ground and
![AirSpeed](https://i.imgur.com/13GW9xQ.png) air movement speed,
among other abilities, with additional modules.
- Protect yourself from enemies (and your fellow pioneers) with a variety of
![BlastPlating](https://i.imgur.com/ZLayQ7U.png) protective modules and
![Shield](https://i.imgur.com/rgnwkUy.png) shields.
- See clearly at night with the
![NightVision](https://i.imgur.com/erv7HNj.png) Night Vision Module.
- Access craft benches on the go with the
![MobileWorkbench](https://i.imgur.com/oODf4Sp.png) Mobile Workstation Modules.
- ![NeverDie](https://i.imgur.com/66eeeR4.png)

## FAQ - please read if you have an issue!

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

- How do I get started with the mod?
  - Keep reading below the FAQ section.
- Where do I craft Modules and Suits?
  - You can craft them at the Fabrication Station, a new crafting station that is unlocked by the T2 milestone 'PowerSuit Fabrication'
- None of the milestones are appearing in the H.U.B. !
  - Only milestones for Suits appear in the H.U.B, as all Modules and crafting components are found in research trees in the MAM.
- Why is the Suit not letting me install module _____?
  - If the suit blocks you from installing a module, you likely have a conflicting module installed. Read the module's descriptions to find out why this might be the case. You can't install modules while the suit is rebooting, but you can remove them.
- Can I rebind what keys the suit uses?
  - Yes! With the power of the SML3 keybind system, it is now possible. You can find them on the base game Keybindings screen. If you want to add overlapping keybinds (which the game does not normally allow you to do) you edit your `GameUserSettings.ini` file, which can be found at `...\AppData\Local\FactoryGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor`
- Why are the sounds so loud?
  - You can configure the mod's volume levels (or disable sound outright) from the mod settings, accessible on the main menu Mods section.
- Why do I crash on launch?
  - This mod depends on other mods to be installed, and you are probably missing them. Use the Mod Manager to install, it will download them all for you automatically.
- Why is everything so complicated?
  - I wanted to provide as much information as possible in the module descriptions, which can make them seem a bit daunting. It's really quite simple at the core, though. Modules consume fuel and power, and sometimes speed you up or slow you down, or give you other benefits or abilities. You have to use other modules to offset power and fuel costs, or to speed you back up again. Please feel free to contact me with any suggestions or questions.
- Why my suit keep saying ERR_SUIT_POWER_EXHAUSTED and turning off?
  - You're running out of Suit power! Consider adding modules that increase Capacity and Power Generation, or removing some of your more power-hungry modules.
- Module _____ isn't working!
  - This mod is still actively in development. Please check the **Known Bugs** and **Multiplayer Compatibility Notes** sections at the top of this page, as well as the [Github issues page](https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/issues/), to see if it has already been reported. If not, please send a message on the [Nog's Mods Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu) to let me know, or [post an issue on Github](https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/issues/new/choose).
- Why can I craft the Dirty Reactor Module before I have access to nuclear processing and the Hazmat Suit?
  - This is an intended feature. Perhaps there's another way to protect yourself from the radiation damage you take crafting the module?
- Why is everything so cheap/expensive/overpowered/weak?
  - I tried to balance the recipe costs and functionality of these modules according to my tastes, but I'm open to suggestions - contact me on the modding Discord, or the [Nog's Mods Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu). Feel free to create a mod of your own to overwrite my mod's recipes for these items. [ContentLib Recipes](https://ficsit.app/mod/5ak7eHymSNw4YN) makes it as simple as writing a JSON file to do so.

</details>

## Getting Started

### Coming Prepared

PowerSuit Modules now consists of multiple smaller sub-mods as opposed to one monolithic mod. If you have only installed the base mod, you should probably get some others if you want your suits to do anything.

- Pick and choose the sub-mods you want to play with, but I suggest using the [All Modules Modpack](https://ficsit.app/mod/CEjJnBXkLEiszx) for the best experience
- More sub-mods will be released in the future, potentially with modules that offer content for your other favorite mods
- **All sub-mods are linked from the top of the mod page (click the images!)**

[![Modpack](https://i.imgur.com/fr5kNHn.png)](https://ficsit.app/mod/CEjJnBXkLEiszx) _Install the All Modules Modpack here!_

### Opening the Door

The mod opens up once you have access to Caterium, so go out scouting and find some! Once you have some, find the T2 milestone 'PowerSuit Fabrication,' where you can work with R&D to develop the Biofuel Suit and the **Fabrication Station**.

Each module is crafted from a
![BaseModuleComponent](https://i.imgur.com/WJ1xfNw.png) **Module Base Component**
and a handful of other components.
New modules are unlocked in the **MAM** and crafted in the **Fabrication Station**.

![Fabrication Station](https://i.imgur.com/0ysqT57.jpeg)

It might look a little familiar to some of you. After all, R&D does not waste.

You can craft Module Base Components with just Iron-tier components, but _it is more costly to do so_. If you wait until T3-4 when you have access to Steel-tier components, you can **unlock a cheaper recipe in the MAM.**

Do note that each Module Base Component requires a Power Shard to craft - but there are some alternate recipes you can unlock that don't need Power Shards.

### Module Basics

**All modules have extensive descriptions of what they do in their item descriptions.**

By the power of [MAM Enhancer](https://ficsit.app/mod/EPUmESEWaBCk4n), you can view what modules are going to do before you unlock them! Simply select a MAM node in the tree, and MAM Enhancer will display a description of the node on the right, as well as allow you to view tooltips of the items you need to submit, or click on them to open them in your Item Codex.

If you want to see a module's description again, you can always come back to the MAM, search it in the Item Codex (press X) or Quick Search (press U). More methods are described below in the *More Details* section further down on the page.

### Installing Modules

Once you equip your PowerSuit a new section will appear in your main inventory below your hand slots, as well as a panel on the right. You can **install modules by dragging them into the new slots like you would a chest.** Note that Shift clicking is not supported yet. If the suit blocks you from installing a module, you likely have a conflicting module installed. Read the module's descriptions to find out why this might be the case.

![Install Modules](https://i.imgur.com/rTIhLlI.png)

You can also press _'PowerSuit: Open Suit UI'_ (Right Alt by default) to open the suit's custom window, and press tab to open your inventory.

<details>
<summary> Suit Window screenshot </summary>

![SuitWindow](https://i.imgur.com/kwLZQWD.png)

</details>

You can check out the *Stats* section of the suit inventory screen to see information about your suit. Note that not all abilities a module gives you can be shown in this stats screen.

### Suit Usage and Controls

Once you unlock the Biofuel Suit, you will receive a message in your in-game Inbox from R&D in the Tutorials section (default X to open). This message has information about the controls. See the directions in the FAQ for rebinding keys.

You can activate or configure the properties of various modules from the 'Modules' and 'Config' sections of the suit inventory widget.

![Configure IMWs](https://i.imgur.com/gFmmqwZ.png)

## Handheld Controllers

All suits, even those not capable of flight, will give you handheld hoverpack controllers with useful suit information. If you don't want this, you can turn it off in the PowerSuit mod config in the main menu.

Below is an image which labels what portions of the controllers correspond to what suit information.

![Controllers Labelled](https://i.imgur.com/MsweUXe.png)

If you start to Overdraw your suit (explained further below) the screens will get a red warning background and the Overdraw bar will increase until your suit shorts.

![Overdraw](https://i.imgur.com/DuTiMrk.png)

## Tooltips

All Suits and some Modules will show additional information when you hover over their item tooltips.

Suits will display what item is currently in their internal fuel buffer, as well was what modules are installed.

![Suit tooltip](https://i.imgur.com/qOKA1Io.png)

The Gas Mask and Hazmat Suit modules will show how much of their current filter is remaining before they need to refuel.

## Suit HUD

The suit HUD tells you a lot of information about your suit and your player at a glance.

![SuitHUDOverview](https://i.imgur.com/BzcsBDY.png)

A couple of extra details on the non-trivial portions:

- The Shield, Power, and Fuel bars (from top to bottom) correspond to the percentage values to their left, and will display `---%` when the suit can't hold any.
- The Fuse Indicator will be green when the suit is operating as normal, orange when Overdrawing, and red when Rebooting
- The Intensity of Change indicators are arrows that show how much their respective stat is currently changing. The more significant the change, the more chevrons.
- The Suit Mode Indicators inform you of the following:
  - Airplane: You are currently flying
  - Fuel Pump: Your Suit lacks items required for refueling. TODO test this
  - Shield: If solid, your shield is on recharge cooldown. If flashing, your shield is currently recharging. TODO behavior flashing?
  - Weight: If shown, your suit is in Gravity Flight Mode. See the Flight section for more info.
  - Two Feathers: If shown, your suit is in Frictionless Flight Override Mode. See the Flight section for more info.

## Suit Concepts

### Power

[![PowerGeneration](https://i.imgur.com/qPR2fwd.png)](https://ficsit.app/mod/FJxNuUm6aAEmzV) [![SuitRegulation](https://i.imgur.com/KutlEGt.png)](https://ficsit.app/mod/2bNso1rZPJqzub) _The Power Generation and Suit Regulation sub mods contain modules that help manage your Suit Power and Fuel._

**Power** is electrical energy essential for the operation of most modules. Modules will either consume or generate power. A small amount of Power is passively produced by your suit, but you must install additional modules to generate or store more at a time.

Some modules will generate power for free, others will require certain special conditions to be met, and some will consume Suit Fuel (see below) to generate power.

#### **Fuse and Overdraw**

If your suit runs out of power, you will enter **Overdraw**. The HUD's Fuse Indicator light will turn orange, your handheld controllers will gain a red warning background, and their Overdraw progress bar will begin to increase.
While Overdrawing, you can consume an unlimited amount of power, but if you are still out of power when the Overdraw progress bar reaches the maximum, your suit will have to **Reboot**.

![Overdraw](https://i.imgur.com/DuTiMrk.png)

#### **Rebooting**

When your suit begins to reboot, all of your installed Modules will cease to function, and you must wait for the suit to reboot again before you can use them. This is certainly not advantageous while flying, or in a dangerous environment, so consider investing in modules that increase your Power Capacity or Power Generation.

![Rebooting](https://i.imgur.com/y3AaZBe.png)

### **Fuel**

Some modules will also consume Suit **Fuel** to operate. Examples of this include the Integrated Jetpack, Fuel Runners, and Bio Burner modules.

Note that Suit Fuel is not limited to only base-game [Packaged Fuel](https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Packaged_Fuel), your Suit can refuel by consuming any of the items it supports, which can be viewing in the Suit Stats section. Some Modules can grant your suit access to additional fuel item options, or even generate it from nothing.

Your Suit will consume items from your inventory to refuel itself while you are on the ground. After consuming an item, the fuel will transfer into your suit's fuel tank in accordance with its **Fuel Transfer Speed**.

**Fuel Efficiency** is a special bonus that changes how much effective Fuel you get out of the items your suit consumes.

[![Flight](https://i.imgur.com/JBxUd3K.png)](https://ficsit.app/mod/9tusv5NnasQ8tT) _Note: Your suit can refuel mid-air if you have a Mid-Air Refueling Module from the Flight sub mod installed._

Once yoyur

Note that different suits have different Fuel Transfer Speeds and Fuel Efficiency which modules can modify.

This is drained to fill the fuel tank when you are on the ground, and will refill automatically (by consuming items from your inventory) when it reaches 0%. Fuel in the Reserves is not directly accessible by modules.
  - If your suit has high fuel efficiency, it's totally normal for this value to be over 100%. For example, the Biofuel Suit has a 400% fuel efficiency bonus.
  - *Fuel only transfers from the Reserves to the Tank when you are on the ground.* You can install a  ![](https://i.imgur.com/bdOlMoP.png) **Mid-Air Refueling Module** to change this.
  - Fuel is only needed for modules that consume fuel (currently just the Integrated Jetpack, Thrust Boots, and Hover Jetpack)
  - What items can be consumed to refuel the fuel reserves depends on what PowerSuit you have equipped:

### **Shield**

[![PioneerProtection](https://i.imgur.com/kDzBR9p.png)](https://ficsit.app/mod/CpKSGnfYKMuD5u) _The Pioneer Protection sub mod offers modules that grant you Shield._

**Shield** can be thought of as a special health bar that will be taken from before your actual Health. Shields can only absorb certain kinds of damage by default - for example, radiation damage is not stopped by shields.

When your shield takes damage, it will begin to recharge again after a delay.

# OLD

![Suit HUD screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/snuct51.png)

The suit HUD has multiple bars, listed here from top to bottom:

- **Hover and Flight display**
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/FB3gt0a.png)
  - If are flying, a set of wings will appear.
  - If you are in Hover Mode, a set of green feathers appears to the top right of the flight icon.
- **Movement speed display**
  - Displays information about your current velocity in meters per second.
  - The 'up arrow' section displays the magnitude of your vertical velocity vector.
  - The 'right arrow' section displays the magnitude of your horizontal velocity vector.
  - The rightmost number readout with the m/s shows your overall velocity - the combined horizontal and the vertical velocities.
- **Shield - Light Blue** *(Empty unless you have shield modules installed)*
  - Blocks most types of damage before your health is affected.
  - Your shield has a delay before it starts recharging again after you take damage. The remaining time is shown as a little red progress bar by this icon:

  <!--![](https://i.imgur.com/pFLXSYe.png)-->
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/9Pko0kp.png)

  - When your shield is recharging, you'll see an red battery icon above the shield bar:

  <!--![](https://i.imgur.com/xfvLa6r.png)-->
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/dGMe6wO.png)

- **Power - Green**
  - Your suit has an internal battery (Power Total in the Suit Stats window) that acts as its energy reserves, and it comes with a bit of power generation built in.
  - See how much energy your suit is using/generating by looking at the Power Balance readout in the Suit Stats screen. Positive numbers means you have a surplus, negative means you have a shortage. External PowerDraw shows you how much energy you are currently using. It does not include energy consumption due to shields recharging (might in the future)
  - Installing generally modules decreases the maximum internal battery.
  - Some modules consume power to run, which will drain the internal battery's charge.
  - To *raise your internal battery capacity*, install one of the 3 Capacity-boosting modules.
  - To *recharge the internal battery faster*, install one of many Generation modules, which do not currently consume any resources to operate.
  - If the suit runs out of internal battery, it will begin to Overdraw (if your tier of suit has the ability to do so), which is shown as a red progress bar advancing along the top of the Power bar. If the red bar reaches the end, your suit will short, and all modules will cease to function (including Jetpacks    - watch out!)

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/mBjdC6D.png)
  - When the suit shorts, you will have to wait for it to reboot, indicated by the lighting bolt and yellow progress bar. If this doesn't go away, it means you're still consuming too much power for the suit to reboot. Try adding more generators or removing power-consuming modules. This is the reboot icon:

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/eoxOQUv.png)

- **Fuel Reserves - Orange**
  - **Your suit's fuel reserves.** This is drained to fill the fuel tank when you are on the ground, and will refill automatically (by consuming items from your inventory) when it reaches 0%. Fuel in the Reserves is not directly accessible by modules.
  - If your suit has high fuel efficiency, it's totally normal for this value to be over 100%. For example, the Biofuel Suit has a 400% fuel efficiency bonus.
  - *Fuel only transfers from the Reserves to the Tank when you are on the ground.* You can install a  ![](https://i.imgur.com/bdOlMoP.png) **Mid-Air Refueling Module** to change this.
  - Fuel is only needed for modules that consume fuel (currently just the Integrated Jetpack, Thrust Boots, and Hover Jetpack)
  - What items can be consumed to refuel the fuel reserves depends on what PowerSuit you have equipped:

<details>
<summary>Accepted Fuels (click to expand)</summary>

The Biofuel Suit runs on the following fuels, and has 400% fuel efficiency - you get extra suit Fuel compared to if you were using another suit with the same fuels.

- 1x Packaged BioFuel
- 2x Solid Biofuel
- 5x Biomass
- 10x Wood
- 50x Leaves

The PowerSuit Mk1, Mk2, and Mk3 run on the following fuels:

- 1x Packaged TurboFuel
- 2x Packaged Fuel
- 2x Packaged BioFuel
- 2x Solid Biofuel
- 10x Wood
- 200x Leaves

</details>

![](https://i.imgur.com/YR154oF.png)

- **Fuel Tank - Base game body slot display**
  - Shows what tier of suit you are wearing on the far left and the name above the Fuel Tank.
  - Shows what type of fuel is currently being used. In the screenshot, it's Packaged Turbofuel.
  - **Shows how much fuel is currently available to modules.** Currently, only Jetpack-type modules and the Fuel Runners consume fuel. When on the ground, fuel will automatically transfer from the Fuel Reserves to the Fuel Tank, just like how the vanilla Jetpack refills on the ground. You can install a ![](https://i.imgur.com/bdOlMoP.png) **Mid-Air Refueling Module** for this to happen when flying as well.
  - **The higher the energy value of the fuel item, the longer one Fuel Tank will last you**. For example, if the suit is running on Turbofuel, one full tank will let you fly further than if it the suit was running on Leaves or regular Fuel.

## Flight

The [PowerSuit Modules: Flight](https://ficsit.app/mod/9tusv5NnasQ8tT) sub-mod offers a number of balanced flight options. Below are descriptions of their functions and flight controls.

[![Flight modules](https://i.imgur.com/JBxUd3K.png) _These modules are only available when you have the Flight sub mod installed._](https://ficsit.app/mod/9tusv5NnasQ8tT)

### **Flight Modules**

Most Flight Modules consume Fuel, which your suit will refill when you are on the ground. The kind of accepted Fuel depends on the suit and what modules you have installed. Hover over the Accepted Fuels region of the suit inventory to find out what fuels your Suit (and thus Flight Module can run on.)

Review the different types of flight below in the 'Flight Controls' section.

- ![ThrustBoots](https://i.imgur.com/LUbGHnG.png) **Thrust Boots Module**
  - _Consumes Suit Fuel and Power_
  - Thrust Flight with Friction
  - Your first flight opportunity, this limited module allows for some extra mobility, but is nowhere near as good as a jetpack.
  - This flight module will _cap your horizontal speed as you fly_, so don't expect to be zooming around with this one.
- ![Jetpack](https://i.imgur.com/tMw8e92.png) **Integrated Jetpack Module**
  - _Consumes Suit Fuel and Power_
  - Frictionless Thrust Flight
  - The PowerSuit equivalent of the vanilla Jetpack.
  - Your flight range is determined by your suit's fuel tank size, which this module also increases.
- ![HoverJetpack](https://i.imgur.com/x0nhmhN.png) **Hover Jetpack Module**
  - _Consumes Suit Fuel and Power_
  - Hover Flight with Friction
  - The original PowerSuit jetpack - we had hover flight before it was cool!
  - A weaker version of the Hover Pack that is accessible at the same tech tier as the Jetpack.
- ![Hoverpack](https://i.imgur.com/9ESxs4c.png) **Integrated Hoverpack Module**
  - _Consumes exclusively Power_
  - Hover Flight with Friction
  - The PowerSuit equivalent of the vanilla Hover Pack.
  - Does not currently connect to your base's electric grid. That feature is coming in future versions.

### **Flight Controls**

There are two types of flight that modules can grant. Don't worry - you're already familiar with them from the base game.

- ![Jetpack](https://i.imgur.com/tMw8e92.png) ![ThrustBoots](https://i.imgur.com/LUbGHnG.png) **Thrust Flight** (also called Gravity Flight)
  - _Similar to the vanilla Jetpack_
  - Hold space to ascend. You will fall to the ground when not pressing space.
  - Press 'PowerSuit Accelerate' (Shift by default) for a boost.
  - You can speed up your fall by holding crouch.
- ![Hoverpack](https://i.imgur.com/9ESxs4c.png) ![HoverJetpack](https://i.imgur.com/x0nhmhN.png) **Hover Flight**
  - _Similar to the vanilla Hover Pack_
  - Hold space to ascend. You will not descend until you press your crouch key.
  - Press 'PowerSuit Accelerate' (Shift by default) for a boost.
  - In order to descend, you must press your crouch key.
  - Double-tap crouch to stop flying is not currently implemented. That feature is coming soon in a future version.

To help understand the types of flight, think of the base-game Jetpack versus the Hover Pack. A Jetpack has Gravity Flight, but a Hover Pack has Hover Flight.

There are two flight friction behaviors to consider as well:

- ![Jetpack](https://i.imgur.com/tMw8e92.png) **Frictionless Flight**
  - _Similar to the vanilla Jetpack_
  - When you stop pressing the movement keys, you will keep your horizontal momentum, continuing to move through the air. This is  great for if you've just shot yourself out of a Hypertube Cannon, but not so great for precise building.
- ![Hoverpack](https://i.imgur.com/9ESxs4c.png) ![HoverJetpack](https://i.imgur.com/x0nhmhN.png) ![ThrustBoots](https://i.imgur.com/LUbGHnG.png) **Friction Flight**
  - _Similar to the vanilla Hover Pack_
  - When you stop pressing the movement keys, you will be gradually brought to a stop mid-air, losing your horizontal momentum.

To help understand the flight friction behaviors, think of the base-game Jetpack versus the Hover Pack. A Jetpack has Frictionless Flight, but a Hover Pack has Friction Flight, because it slows you to a stop.

Consider using other modules to change the flight behavior and speed of your suit.

- The **Mid-Air Refueling** module enables refueling while still flying.
- The **Configurable Dampening** module enables modifying the strength of flight friction, or removing it entirely, right from your inventory.

## Mod Configuration

You can configure a number of properties of the mod to your liking using the SML Configs system, accessible from the main menu. Here is a sampling of the config options available.

## More Details

You can view the item description of a module before you craft it to see what it does. You can do this in a variety of ways:

1. Hover over it in the H.U.B. milestone it's a part of
2. Check it out in the Item Codex (default 'x'). All modules should have the word 'module' in their name for easy search.
3. Hover over the 'output item' icon in the middle section of the Equipment Workbench GUI. It can be troublesome to get your cursor in the right position for this.

I did my best to balance these modules recipes with respect to when you can obtain them. I am actively looking for feedback on this - please contact me if you have suggestions.

A lot of the heavy lifting to make this mod possible is actually done in the PowerSuit mod itself. If you're interested in seeing what's possible with the mod or making some modules of your own, I strongly suggest you check out its mod page for more info.

If you're interested in making your own modules or recipes for these modules, both this mod and the base PowerSuit mod are open source. Feel free to check out the source code or contact either Nog or I via the Satisfactory Modding Discord for more info.

## Updates and Patch Notes

I am quite a busy person, and it may take me a while to update the mod if it breaks. Please be patient when the game updates and please report any issues you encounter on the Discord or GitHub, both linked above. Feel free to contact me on Discord with any questions, suggestions, or comments you may have.

## Future Update Plans (in no particular order)

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

- Create ADA messages for the new MAM Tree milestones
  - My old ones for the HUB no longer fit because of how the categories are broken down now
- Finish modules marked as WIP
  - Balance suggestions greatly appreciated
- Give everything Resource Sink point values
- Continue to evaluate balance of existing modules
  - Ensure that you can't get too ridiculously overpowered or make power management a complete non-issue
- Almost all of the mod's elements pull their text from String Tables now, which means localized copies of the mods are within reach. Please contact me if you would like to help translate the mod to another language.
- More modules!
  - Damage resistance against enemies, but I think shields already fulfill this role pretty well.
  - Fuel backup system for when the suit runs out of power
  - Fun late game modules like out-of-bounds damage immunity
  - Fuel efficiency increaser
  - Sliding Generator
- My secret list of things on my Trello

Remember - this mod and the base PowerSuit mod are open source, and you're totally free to create your own modules with these as inspiration.

- 3D models for any modules
  - I don't plan to make custom models for the modules or crafting materials any time soon. They don't really have much of a reason to be moving around on conveyors or on the ground anyways.
  - I may need some icons made in the future, though. If you would like to contribute models/icons for them I would greatly appreciate it.
