<details>
<summary> Multiplayer Compatibility Notes </summary>

The mod is designed with Multiplayer in mind,
but you are more likely to encounter bugs there due to the extra layers of complication it adds.
See the 'Multiplayer Compatibility Notes' section below, and please report any bugs you encounter.

Also see the "Known Bugs and Mod Incompatibilities" section.

Please report any issues to me (Robb#6731) on the [Nog's Mods Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu).

- Clients may have to re-equip the suit upon login for some suit functions to work.
- The "Storage Compartment" module can only be interacted with by the host.
- Settings that clients select in their own Mod Options (that differ from the host) may or may not work on a case by case basis. I have designed things with the client in mind, but have not done much testing with these yet.
- (Unconfirmed in Update 4, 5, and 6) If a client logs out with radioactive items in their inventory or in a radioactive area, their 'ghost' player could die to radiation while they are offline.

Also check the 'Multiplayer Compatibility Notes' section, and the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/issues/).

### Mod Incompatibilities

If you try to use these mods at the same time as PowerSuit, something will not work as expected.

- [Stack Overflow](https://ficsit.app/mod/StackOverload) can cause the Logistic Modules to behave unusually.
- [Infinity Dynamic Inventory Slot](https://ficsit.app/mod/DynamicInventorySlot) will cause significant lag when using the Mobile Auto-Crafting functionality of the mobile workbench modules.
- [Level Up](https://ficsit.app/mod/KLevelUp). The suit and LevelUp stats applications conflict with each other. The mods will not _crash_ when used at the same time, but speccing into movement speed or resistances and the like will result in weird behavior if you try to use modules that do the same thing.
- [Auto Get Loot](https://ficsit.app/mod/AutoGetLoot). Seems to spawn something mid-air that you collide with, interrupting flight.

### Major

- Flight sounds are not yet implemented (this is really complex, and a half baked solution will make it worse, sorry)

### Minor

- Modules that grant allowed fuels will sometimes add them to the wrong end of the allowed fuels list. Re-equip your suit after installing to correct this. Remember that the slot ordering in the suit controls which fuel-granting modules are placed first in the list.
- In-place swapping of modules inside the suit can cause the stats of the modules to be double-counted until you re-equip the suit. This was a result of partially fixing a crash, but I don't have time to fully fix this right now.
- Flight starts 'early,' if you have any additional jumps via mods such as Double Jump

## Introduction

Originally the go-to mod for additional equipment slots,
this mod adds a whole bunch of modular equipment items for use in your **multiplayer-compatible**
[PowerSuit](https://ficsit.app/mod/PowerSuit),
inspired by Factorio's [Power Armor system](https://wiki.factorio.com/Power_armor_MK2).
The mod introduces 4 different Suits in which Modules can be installed,
the first of which is accessible as soon as you get Blade Runners.

Please leave suggestions and report issues either on the
[Nog's Mods Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu)
or [as a Github issue](https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/issues/new/choose).

You can either install the specific Module mods you want to use, or play the intended PowerSuit Modules experience by [installing the Modpack!](https://ficsit.app/mod/ArmorModules__Modpack_All)

## Feature Overview

- Customize the function of your PowerSuit to your liking.
  There is no 'perfect' setup - you get to decide what is important to you.

## FAQ - please read if you have an issue!

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

- _Why is X not working?_
  - Check the 'Known Bugs and Mod Incompatibilities' collapsible section at the top of the page, then keep reading the FAQ. If you still haven't found it, ask on the Nog's Mods discord (linked above).
- _How do I get started with the mod?_
  - Keep reading below the FAQ section.
- _Where do I craft Modules and Suits?_
  - You can craft them at the 'Fabrication Station,' a new crafting station that is unlocked by the T2 milestone 'PowerSuit Fabrication'
- _None of the milestones are appearing in the H.U.B. !_
  - Only milestones for Suits appear in the H.U.B, as all Modules and crafting components are found in research trees in the MAM.
- _Why is the Suit not letting me install module `_____`?_
  - If the suit blocks you from installing a module, you likely have a conflicting module installed. Read the module's descriptions to find out why this might be the case. You can't install modules while the suit is rebooting, but you can remove them.
- _Can I rebind what keys the suit uses?_
  - Yes! With the power of the SML3 keybind system, it is now possible. You can find them on the base game Keybindings screen. If you want to add overlapping keybinds (which the game does not normally allow you to do) you edit your `GameUserSettings.ini` file, which can be found at `...\AppData\Local\FactoryGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor`. If the keybinds aren't showing up in the list for some reason, make sure that you don't have them listed in your `Input.ini` file, which is known to prevent them from appearing.
- _Some of the mod's recipes use Somersloops, but I don't want to use them up from my world!_
  - Coffee Stain has said that these items will be story related and likely will not be given use until Update 1.0, which is quite a ways in the future. I will re-evaluate the mod recipes once Somersloops are given a real use in base game.
  - If you would like to conserve your save's Somersloops, you can purchase Synchronized Somerslink Regulators from the AWESOME shop once you have unlocked them.
  - A late-game production chain allows you to produce Stable Somersloops out of renewable resources.
  - Note that recipes involving Somersloop products often return the Somersloop in another form - the Somersloop is not used up. It's a catalyst item.
- _Why are the sounds so loud?_
  - You can configure the mod's volume levels (or disable sound outright) from the mod settings, accessible on the main menu Mods section.
- _Why do I crash on launch?_
  - This mod depends on other mods to be installed, and you are probably missing them. Use the Mod Manager to install, it will download them all for you automatically.
- _Why is everything so complicated?_
  - I wanted to provide as much information as possible in the module descriptions, which can make them seem a bit daunting. It's really quite simple at the core, though. Modules consume fuel and power, and sometimes speed you up or slow you down, or give you other benefits or abilities. You have to use other modules to offset power and fuel costs, or to speed you back up again. Please feel free to contact me with any suggestions or questions.
- Why my suit keep saying ERR_SUIT_POWER_EXHAUSTED and turning off?
  - You're running out of Suit power! Consider adding modules that increase Capacity and Power Generation, or removing some of your more power-hungry modules.
- _This module isn't working!_
  - This mod is still actively in development. Please check the **Known Bugs** and **Multiplayer Compatibility Notes** sections at the top of this page, as well as the [Github issues page](https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/issues/), to see if it has already been reported. If not, please send a message on the [Nog's Mods Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu) to let me know, or [post an issue on Github](https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/issues/new/choose).
- _Why can I craft the Radiation Absorbing Generator before I have access to nuclear processing and the Hazmat Suit?_
  - This is an intended feature. Perhaps there's another way to protect yourself from the radiation damage you take crafting the module?
- _Why is everything so cheap/expensive/overpowered/weak?_
  - I tried to balance the recipe costs and functionality of these modules according to my tastes, but I'm open to suggestions - contact me on the modding Discord, or the [Nog's Mods Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu). Feel free to create a mod of your own to overwrite my mod's requirements for these items. [ContentLib](https://ficsit.app/mod/ContentLib) makes it as simple as writing a JSON file to do so.

</details>

## Getting Started

### **Installation Instructions** - Coming Prepared

PowerSuit Modules consists of multiple sub-mods as opposed to one monolithic mod.

- Install this individual mod if you want to manually select which other sub-mods to install.
  Otherwise, **install the [All Modules Modpack](https://ficsit.app/mod/CEjJnBXkLEiszx) to grab all of them in one click!**
- More sub-mods will be released in the future,
  potentially with modules that offer content for your other favorite mods!
- **All sub-mods are linked from the top of the mod page (click the images!)**

[![Modpack](https://i.imgur.com/fr5kNHn.png)](https://ficsit.app/mod/CEjJnBXkLEiszx) _Install the All Modules Modpack here!_

To install, **use [Satisfactory Mod Manager](https://smm.ficsit.app/).**
You can also see and download specific versions in the "Versions" tab on this Satisfactory Mod Repository page.

After installing this, you can select to show all 'Enabled' mods (not 'Installed') in the Mod Manager,
which causes all dependency mods to be listed as well.

### Opening the Door

The mod opens up once you have access to Caterium and Quartz, so go out scouting and find some!
Once you have some, find the T2 milestone 'PowerSuit Fabrication,'
where you can work with R&D to develop the Biofuel Suit and the **Fabrication Station**.

Each module is crafted from a
![BaseModuleComponent](https://i.imgur.com/WJ1xfNw.png) **Module Base Component**
and a handful of other components.
New modules are unlocked in the **MAM** (more info on that below) and crafted in the **Fabrication Station**.

![Fabrication Station](https://i.imgur.com/8wJjW8D.jpeg)

It might look a little familiar to some of you long-time Pioneers. After all, R&D does not waste.

You can craft Module Base Components with just Iron-tier components, but _it is costly to do so_.
If you **wait until T3-4** when you have access to Steel-tier components,
you can **unlock a cheaper recipe in the MAM.**

Do note that each Module Base Component requires a Power Shard to craft,
but there are some alternate recipes you can unlock later that don't need Power Shards.
Power Shards are renewable via Lizard Doggos, and other mods if you chose to install them.

### Module Basics

**You can find out what modules are available, and what you'll need to craft them, by exploring the MAM.**

**All modules have extensive descriptions of what they do in their item descriptions!**

By the power of [MAM Enhancer](https://ficsit.app/mod/MAMTips),
you can view what modules are going to do before you unlock them!
Simply select a MAM node in the tree,
and MAM Enhancer will display a description of the node on the right,
as well as allow you to view tooltips of the items you need to submit,
or click on them to open them in your Item Codex.

Each MAM Node is priced so that its unlock cost closely matches the cost of crafting the module.

Modules can be unlocked in roughly any order as long as you have the requisite items.

If you want to see a module's description again, you can always come back to the MAM,
search it in the Item Codex (O by default) or Quick Search (U by default).
You can also hover over the output item icon once the recipe is selected in the Fabrication Station.

![MAM Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/vSDGLMS.png)

### Installing Modules

Once you equip your PowerSuit, a new section will appear in your main inventory below your hand slots,
as well as a panel on the right (the 'Overview' tab).
You can **install modules by dragging them into the new slots like you would a container.**
Note that Shift clicking is not supported yet.
If the suit blocks you from installing a module, you likely have a conflicting module installed.
Read your modules' descriptions to find out why this might be the case.

<!-- TODO updated image -->

![Install Modules](https://i.imgur.com/rTIhLlI.png)

### Suit Interface Tabs

Once you're wearing a suit, your inventory screen gains a new panel on the right with 3 tabs - 'Overview', 'Stats', and 'Extended'.

#### Overview

In the **Overview** tab, you can view status displays
and quick settings for the modules you have installed.

If the tab is empty, you do not have any
modules in your suit that support this.
Once you have, this tab will open by default
instead of the **Stats** tab.

![Overview tab](https://i.imgur.com/M4CaJTD.png)

#### Stats

In the **Stats** tab, you can view your suit
stats at a glance, as well as in detail via
their internal property names, which is
helpful for debugging. Note that not
all suit abilities are possible to display here.

Hover over various parts of the display
to get more information on them.

![Stats tab](https://i.imgur.com/vhY5Upp.png)

### Suit Popup Window

Selecting the Extended tab, or pressing _'PowerSuit: Open Suit UI'_ (Right Alt by default) will open the suit's custom window, and also reveal the 'Configs' tab.

This window can be repositioned via dragging, and resized via the bottom right corner.

![Resize window functionality](https://i.imgur.com/eQ5Jk4V.png)

#### Extended

In the **Extended** tab, you can view and modify
the extended settings of modules, or interact
with them in a way that requires keyboard input,
or more space than is present on the inventory screen.

If the tab is empty, you do not have any
modules equipped in your suit that offer said settings.

![Extended tab](https://i.imgur.com/exSELS5.png)

#### Configs

The Suit UI also offers the **Configs** tab.

In the Configs tab, you can view and edit
the Mod Configuration options for all
PowerSuit family mods you have installed in your game.

Note that you can also access this
from the pause menu ('Mod Configs' section)
and from the 'Mods' list on the Main Menu.

You may need to re-equip worn suits for some config changes to take effect.

Remember that configs should match for most options in multiplayer!

![Configs tab](https://i.imgur.com/g3uUNpg.png)

<!-- Old -->
<!-- ![SuitWindow](https://i.imgur.com/kwLZQWD.png) -->

### Suit Usage and Controls

Once you unlock the Biofuel Suit,
you will receive a message in your in-game Inbox from R&D in the Tutorials section
(default O to open, then click 'Tutorials').
This message has information about the controls.
See the directions in this mod page's FAQ for rebinding keys.

You can activate or configure the properties of various modules from the 'Overview' and 'Extended' tabs.

<!-- ![OLD Configure IMWs](https://i.imgur.com/gFmmqwZ.png) -->
![Overview tab](https://i.imgur.com/M4CaJTD.png)

## Handheld Controllers

All suits, even those not capable of flight,
will give you handheld hoverpack controllers with useful suit information.
If you don't want this, you can turn it off in the PowerSuit mod config.

Below is an image that labels what portions of the controllers correspond to what suit information.

![Controllers Labelled](https://i.imgur.com/MsweUXe.png)

If you start to Overdraw your suit (explained further below) the screens will get a red warning background and the Overdraw bar will increase until your suit shorts.

![Overdraw](https://i.imgur.com/DuTiMrk.png)

## Tooltips

All Suits and some Modules will show additional information when you hover over their item tooltips.

Suits will display what item is currently in their internal fuel buffer, as well was what modules are installed.

![Suit tooltip](https://i.imgur.com/qOKA1Io.png)

The Gas Mask and Hazmat Suit modules will show how much of their current filter is remaining before they need to refuel.

## Suit HUD

The suit HUD tells you a lot of information about your suit and your player at a glance.

If you'd like, you can edit the mod configuration options to reposition it on your screen and change how transparent it is.

![SuitHUDOverview](https://i.imgur.com/BzcsBDY.png)

A couple of extra details on the non-trivial portions:

- The Shield, Power, and Fuel bars (from top to bottom) correspond to the percentage values to their left, and will display `---%` when the suit can't hold any.
- The Fuse Indicator will be green when the suit is operating as normal, orange when Overdrawing, and red when Rebooting
- The Intensity of Change indicators are arrows that show how much their respective stat is currently changing. The more significant the change, the more chevrons.
- The Suit Mode Indicators inform you of the following:
  - Airplane: You are currently flying
  - Fuel Pump: Appears when your suit is low on Suit Fuel. If this remains showing and your suit is not re-fueling, you probably lack the items required for refueling. See the Fuel section for more info.
  - Shield: If this icon is flashing, your shield is currently on recharge cooldown.
  - Weight: If shown, your suit is in Gravity Flight Mode. See the Flight section for more info.
  - Two Feathers: If shown, your suit is in Frictionless Flight Override Mode. See the Flight section for more info.

## Suit Concepts

### Power

[![PowerGeneration](https://i.imgur.com/qPR2fwd.png)](https://ficsit.app/mod/FJxNuUm6aAEmzV) [![SuitRegulation](https://i.imgur.com/KutlEGt.png)](https://ficsit.app/mod/2bNso1rZPJqzub) _The Power Generation and Suit Regulation sub mods contain modules that help manage your Suit Power and Fuel._

**Power** is electrical energy essential for the operation of most modules.
Modules will generally either consume or generate power.

Your suit stores Power like a battery - the total it can store is determined by the Power Capacity stat.
Your suit HUD, handheld controllers, and the Stats suit tab will show you how much Power Capacity you have.
The Stats suit tab also displays exactly the current net rate of change of your suit's stored power - positive is a profit, negative is a loss.

A small amount of Power is passively produced by your suit for free, but you must install additional modules to generate or store more at a time.

Some modules will generate power for free, others will require certain special conditions to be met, and some will consume Suit Fuel (see below) to generate power.

#### **Overdraw and Fuse**

If your suit runs out of power, you will enter **Overdraw**. The HUD's Fuse Indicator light will turn orange, a warning sound will play, your handheld controllers will gain a red warning background, and their Overdraw progress bar will begin to increase.
While Overdrawing, you can consume an unlimited amount of power, but if you are still out of power when the Overdraw progress bar reaches the maximum, your suit will have to **Reboot**.

![Overdraw](https://i.imgur.com/DuTiMrk.png)

#### **Rebooting**

When your suit begins to reboot, most of your installed Modules will cease to function, and you must wait for the suit to recover before you can use them.
This is certainly not advantageous while flying, or while in a dangerous environment, so consider investing in modules that increase your Power Capacity or Power Generation.

The amount of time left in a reboot is displayed in your Suit HUD and handheld controllers via a progress bar. When the bar is full, the reboot is complete.

When your suit is Rebooting, you can not install any new modules, you can only uninstall them.
If you're stuck in a reboot loop, take out some of the power-hungry modules to analyze what you need to modify to avoid the reboot loop in the future.

![Rebooting](https://i.imgur.com/y3AaZBe.png)

### **Fuel**

You Suit can also hold Suit Fuel. Although your Suit will attempt to hold a buffer of Suit Fuel at all times, it **does not consume any Suit Fuel on its own** - **specific Modules require it to operate**. Examples of this include the Integrated Jetpack, Fuel Runners, and Bio Burner modules.

Note that Suit Fuel is not limited to only base-game [Packaged Fuel](https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Packaged_Fuel) - your Suit can refuel by consuming any of the items it supports, which can be viewing in the Suit Stats section. Some Modules can grant your suit access to additional fuel item options (for example, the Integrated Jetpack allows all suits to use Packaged Fuel), or even generate Suit Fuel for you without consuming any items.

You can find a comparion of the different kinds of fuels suits can use (assuming access to all tech tiers) [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yn1Pswj76ZDBuDiWO8Alr5WgTfqHipKUIJsz8m7AbfI/edit).

![Allowed Fuels](https://i.imgur.com/ZMdYfiV.png)

Your Suit will consume items from your inventory to refuel itself **while you are on the ground.** After consuming an item, the fuel will transfer into your suit's fuel tank in accordance with its **Fuel Transfer Speed**. This ensures that none of the potential fuel energy of the item is wasted. When fuel is transferring, the wheel on the UI will spin. The background fill of the wheel shows how much of the last consumed item remains before another is consumed. You can also see how much remains in the buffer by looking at the suit's item tooltip.

<details>
<summary> Suit Tooltip </summary>

Note that the accepted fuels listed here are the ones the suit unlocks by default. The true list (which could have been modified by Modules) is found in the suit stats section.

![Suit tooltip](https://i.imgur.com/qOKA1Io.png)

</details>

[![Flight](https://i.imgur.com/JBxUd3K.png)](https://ficsit.app/mod/9tusv5NnasQ8tT) _Note: Your suit can refuel mid-air if you have a ![MidAirRefuel](https://i.imgur.com/bdOlMoP.png) Mid-Air Refueling Module from the Flight sub mod installed._

Note that different suits have different Fuel Transfer Speeds and Fuel Efficiency values, which can also be further modified by Modules.

**Fuel Transfer Speed** defines how quickly your suit's Fuel tank will refill from the items it consumes. Sometimes Modules or suits will affect this value by some fixed fuel quantity in MJ per second, and others will affect the percentage of your suit's fuel capacity that can be moved per second (scales well with larger fuel tanks).

**Fuel Efficiency** is a special bonus that changes how much effective Suit Fuel you get out of the items your suit consumes. Higher Fuel Efficiency means each fuel item will give you more Suit Fuel than its listed value, leading to less fuel item consumption. Lower fuel efficiency can result in increased fuel item consumption.

#### Fuel Recovery Period

If you entirely drain your suit of Suit Fuel, and a module is still trying to consume fuel, the suit will enter a 5-second fuel recovery period to allow suit functions to refill the fuel tanks.

During this period, all fuel consuming modules will cease to function, a (mod options configurable) sound will play at the start of the timeframe, and the suit UI will notify you of the fuel shortage through various indicators:

- Handheld controllers have blinking out of fuel indicators
- A notice is displayed above the suit item slots in the inventory screen
- Suit HUD displays a blinking out of fuel icon. A gray progress bar indicates how much time remains in the recovery period.
- Suit HUD's fuse indicator turns yellow

Once fuel is obtained again, the fuel-starved modules will resume functioning again.

If you don't obtain more fuel, the warnings will continue displaying until fuel is obtained.

### **Shield**

[![PioneerProtection](https://i.imgur.com/kDzBR9p.png)](https://ficsit.app/mod/CpKSGnfYKMuD5u) _The Pioneer Protection sub mod offers modules that grant you Shield._

**Shield** can be thought of as a special health bar that will be taken from before your actual Health. Shields can only absorb certain kinds of damage by default - for example, radiation damage is not stopped by shields.

When your shield takes damage, it will begin to recharge again after a delay.

## Flight

The [PowerSuit Modules: Flight](https://ficsit.app/mod/9tusv5NnasQ8tT) sub-mod offers a number of balanced flight options. Below are descriptions of their functions and flight controls.

[![Flight modules](https://i.imgur.com/JBxUd3K.png) _These modules are only available when you have the Flight sub mod installed._](https://ficsit.app/mod/9tusv5NnasQ8tT)

Having any PowerSuit Flight Module equipped will fix the base-game bug of drifting while hovering at very small horizontal speeds.

### **Flight Modules**

Most Flight Modules consume Suit Fuel, which your suit will refill when you are on the ground. The kind of accepted Fuel depends on the suit and what modules you have installed. Hover over the Accepted Fuels region of the suit inventory to find out what fuels your Suit (and thus Flight Module can run on.)

Review the different types of flight below in the 'Flight Controls' section.

- ![ThrustBoots](https://i.imgur.com/LUbGHnG.png) **Thrust Boots Module**
  - _Consumes Suit Fuel and Power_
  - Thrust Flight with Friction
  - Your first flight opportunity, this limited module allows for some extra mobility, but is nowhere near as good as a jetpack.
  - This flight module will _cap your horizontal speed as you fly_, so don't expect to be zooming around with this one.
- ![Jetpack](https://i.imgur.com/tMw8e92.png) **Integrated Jetpack Module**
  - _Consumes Suit Fuel and Power_
  - Frictionless Thrust Flight
  - The PowerSuit equivalent of the vanilla Jetpack.
  - Your flight range is determined by your suit's fuel tank size, which this module also increases.
- ![HoverJetpack](https://i.imgur.com/x0nhmhN.png) **Hover Jetpack Module**
  - _Consumes Suit Fuel and Power_
  - Hover Flight with Friction
  - The original PowerSuit jetpack - we had hover flight before it was cool!
  - A weaker version of the Hover Pack that is accessible at the same tech tier as the Jetpack.
- ![Hoverpack](https://i.imgur.com/9ESxs4c.png) **Integrated Hoverpack Module**
  - _Consumes exclusively Power_
  - Hover Flight with Friction
  - The PowerSuit equivalent of the vanilla Hover Pack.
  - Does not connect to your base's electric grid. That feature is coming in future versions.
- ![MultiFlight](https://i.imgur.com/l5OdPsV.png) **Adaptive Flight Module**
  - _Consumes exclusively Power_
  - Frictionless Thrust Flight OR Hover Flight with Friction
  - Allows you to swap between Thrust and Hover flight on the fly (ba dun tss).
  - Use your 'PowerSuit: Toggle Gravity Flight' keybind (G by default) to toggle between flight modes

### **Flight Controls**

There are two types of flight that modules can grant. Don't worry - you're already familiar with them from the base game.

- ![Jetpack](https://i.imgur.com/tMw8e92.png) ![ThrustBoots](https://i.imgur.com/LUbGHnG.png) ![MultiFlight](https://i.imgur.com/l5OdPsV.png) **Thrust Flight** (also called Gravity Flight)
  - _Similar to the vanilla Jetpack_
  - Hold space to ascend. You will fall to the ground when not pressing space.
  - Press 'PowerSuit Accelerate' (Shift by default) for a boost.
  - You can speed up your fall by holding crouch.
- ![Hoverpack](https://i.imgur.com/9ESxs4c.png) ![HoverJetpack](https://i.imgur.com/x0nhmhN.png) ![MultiFlight](https://i.imgur.com/l5OdPsV.png) **Hover Flight**
  - _Similar to the vanilla Hover Pack_
  - Hold space to ascend. You will not descend until you press your crouch key.
  - Press 'PowerSuit Accelerate' (Shift by default) for a boost.
  - In order to descend, you must press your crouch key.
  - Double-tap crouch to instantly stop flying.

To help understand the types of flight, think of the base-game Jetpack versus the Hover Pack. A Jetpack has Gravity Flight, but a Hover Pack has Hover Flight.

There are two flight friction behaviors to consider as well:

- ![Jetpack](https://i.imgur.com/tMw8e92.png) ![MultiFlight](https://i.imgur.com/l5OdPsV.png) **Frictionless Flight**
  - _Similar to the vanilla Jetpack_
  - When you stop pressing the movement keys, you will keep your horizontal momentum, continuing to move through the air. This is great for if you've just shot yourself out of a Hypertube Cannon, but not so great for precise building.
- ![Hoverpack](https://i.imgur.com/9ESxs4c.png) ![ThrustBoots](https://i.imgur.com/LUbGHnG.png) ![HoverJetpack](https://i.imgur.com/x0nhmhN.png) ![MultiFlight](https://i.imgur.com/l5OdPsV.png) **Friction Flight**
  - _Similar to the vanilla Hover Pack_
  - When you stop pressing the movement keys, you will be gradually brought to a stop mid-air, losing your horizontal momentum.

To help understand the flight friction behaviors, think of the base-game Jetpack versus the Hover Pack. A Jetpack has Frictionless Flight, but a Hover Pack has Friction Flight, because it slows you to a stop.

Consider using other modules to change the flight behavior and speed of your suit.

- Modules exist to increase your speed while flying.
- The ![MidAirRefuel](https://i.imgur.com/bdOlMoP.png) **Mid-Air Refueling** module enables refueling while still flying.
- The ![ConfigDampen](https://i.imgur.com/E6XqR53.png) **Air Resistance Regulator** module enables modifying flight friction intensity, or removing it entirely, configurable on-the-go.

## [Advanced] Somersloop Crafting Loop

Unlocking some of the more advanced modules on offer requires exploring the unusual properties of Somersloops.

If you are having trouble with the Somerslink Regulator crafting chain, look here for tips and more info.

### Loop Diagram

This is a diagram showing how items flow in the Somersloop crafting chain in the mod.

You can view this in-game by holding the keybind mentioned in the tooltip while hovering over a Somersloop-related item in your inventory.

![Somersloop chain](https://i.imgur.com/or4b56i.jpeg)

### Tips

- Note that recipes involving Somersloop products often _return the Somersloop in another form_ - **the Somersloop is not used up**. It's a catalyst item. It changes form when used in recipes, and other recipes must be used to change it back.
  - For example, you can produce unlimited Entangled Particles with only one Somerslink Regulator. Simply use a Particle Accelerator to Overcharge the Depleted regulator that the Entangled Particles recipe produces.
- Check the diagram above for some tips as to how the recipes fit together.
- If you would like to conserve your world's Somersloops, you can purchase Synchronized Somerslink Regulators from the AWESOME shop once you have unlocked them.
- A late-game production loop allows you to produce Stable Somersloops, and thus the rest of the Somersloop products, out of renewable resources.
- You can produce a Depleted Somerslink Regulator by using a Spatial Tear Generator Module from the Fresh from R&D mod. There is also a machine-based recipe on offer, but using the Module is much more resource efficient.

## Mod Configuration

You can configure a number of properties of the mod to your liking using the SML Configs system, accessible from the main menu, or from the suit popup 'Configs' tab, available by pressing _'PowerSuit: Open Suit UI'_ (Right Alt by default). Here is a sampling of the config options:

![Config screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/RIQhVFf.png)

You may need to re-equip worn suits for some config changes to take effect.

Remember that configs should match on host and client for most options in multiplayer!

## Translations

Are you interested in helping to translate the mod to your native language? It could take a while until I figure out how to get these packed into the mod correctly, but if you'd like, you can join the Crowdin [here](https://crwd.in/powersuit-modules) and start translating. Contact me on the [Nog's Mods Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu) if you have any questions, or if you'd like me to add a language other than the ones currently listed.

## Further Ramblings

I did my best to balance these modules recipes with respect to when you can obtain them. I am actively looking for feedback on this - please contact me if you have suggestions.

If you disagree with my balance decisions, and are interested in making your own recipes (or other tweaks) for these modules, I suggest you check out the [ContentLib](https://ficsit.app/mod/ContentLib) mod. With ContentLib, writing your own recipes is as simple is as putting a JSON file in the right folder. And with a bit more knowledge, you can write JSON CDOs to modify the properties of any module to your liking.

Most modules make use of the 'Attachment Actor' system, a PowerSuit extension of the usual attachments used by the base game. This allows installed Modules to execute custom Blueprint (or C++) logic to interface with the suit and the world. This is great, because it means that modules can do a ton of fun stuff that they couldn't before. But it was also a _ton_ of work to get everything brought over from SML2, as I had to rewrite a significant bit of logic that used to be built into the suit. Despite this added complexity, a lot of the heavy lifting to make this mod possible is still done in the PowerSuit mod itself.

If you're interested in seeing what's possible with the mod or making some modules of your own, I suggest you check out the source code, as both this mod and the base PowerSuit mod are open source. Feel free to contact Nog or I on Discord. I would be happy to assist you in developing your own Modules, and you are free to depend on this mod if you want to make use of some of the additional module utilities I have developed.

For developers: All of my MAM tree nodes are automatically generated and populated from item recipes via the tool I wrote for [NogsBPs](https://github.com/Nogg-aholic/NogsBPs). Let me know if you want more info on how to do this yourself.

Remember - this mod and the base PowerSuit mod are open source, and you're totally free to create your own modules with these as inspiration.

- 3D models for any modules
  - I don't plan to make custom models for the modules any time soon. They don't really have much of a reason to be moving around on conveyors or on the ground anyways.
  - I may need some icons made in the future, though. If you would like to contribute models/icons for them, I would greatly appreciate it.

</details>

Hey, you read all the way to the bottom. Thanks! I appreciate that you care about what all I have to say. Have fun with the mod.
