# How to use

Install from [the Satisfactory Mod Repository](http://ficsit.app/) via the Mod Manager. You'll need to have NogsModularArmor installed as well.

# How to develop

Install the necessary dependencies from Nog.

This folder should go into the Content folder of a [SML Unreal project](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader). Make sure to follow the setup directions there to set up said project.

You will need to configure the .uproject to point to the dependencies from Nog.
