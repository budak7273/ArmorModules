R&D has developed a way to modify your Multipurpose Exploration Suit with capabilities of your choosing.
New Recipe unlocked: Biofuel PowerSuit.

Modules can be installed in your Suit, increasing navigational capabilities as well as odds of survival.

Expect more PowerSuit options to become available as you progress in Milestones.
Caution: Using too much power will shut down your suit until it can re boot.
